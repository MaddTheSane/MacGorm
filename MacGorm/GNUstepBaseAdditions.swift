///`NSDebugLLog()` is the basic debug logging macro used to display
///log messages using `NSLog()`, if debug logging was enabled at compile
///time and the appropriate logging level was set at runtime.
///
///Debug logging which can be enabled/disabled by defining *GSDIAGNOSE*
///when compiling and also setting values in the mutable set which
///is set up by `NSProcessInfo`. *GSDIAGNOSE* is defined automatically
///unless *diagnose=no* is specified in the make arguments.
///
///`NSProcess` initialises a set of strings that are the names of active
///debug levels using the '--GNU-Debug=...' command line argument.
///Each command-line argument of that form is removed from
///`NSProcessInfo`'s list of arguments and the variable part
///(...) is added to the set.
///This means that as far as the program proper is concerned, it is
///running with the same arguments as if debugging had not been enabled.
///
///For instance, to debug the `NSBundle` class, run your program with
///'--GNU-Debug=NSBundle'
///You can of course supply multiple '--GNU-Debug=...' arguments to
///output debug information on more than one thing.
///
///`NSUserDefaults` also adds debug levels from the array given by the
///GNU-Debug key ... but these values will not take effect until the
///`+standardUserDefaults` method is called ... so they are useless for
///debugging `NSUserDefaults` itself or for debugging any code executed
///before the defaults system is used.
///
///To embed debug logging in your code you use the `NSDebugLLog()` or
///`NSDebugLog()` macro.  `NSDebugLog()` is just `NSDebugLLog()` with the debug
///level set to `"dflt"`.  So, to activate debug statements that use
///NSDebugLog(), you supply the '--GNU-Debug=dflt' argument to your program.
///
///You can also change the active debug levels under your programs control -
///`NSProcessInfo` has a `[-debugSet]` method that returns the mutable set that
///contains the active debug levels - your program can modify this set.
///
///Two debug levels have a special effect - 'dflt' is the level used for
///debug logs statements where no debug level is specified, and 'NoWarn'
///is used to *disable* warning messages.
///
///As a convenience, there are four more logging macros you can use -
///`NSDebugFLog()`, `NSDebugFLLog()`, `NSDebugMLog()` and `NSDebugMLLog()`.
///These are the same as the other macros, but are specifically for use in
///either functions or methods and prepend information about the file, line
///and either function or class/method in which the message was generated.
/// - parameter level: the debug level to check for.
/// - parameter format: The `NSString`-like format to print to console.

/// `NSWarnLog()` is the basic debug logging macro used to display

/// when compiling.
///
/// You can also disable these messages at runtime by supplying a
/// '--GNU-Debug=NoWarn' argument to the program, or by adding 'NoWarn'
/// to the user default array named 'GNU-Debug'.
///
/// These logging macros are intended to be used when the software detects
/// something that it not necessarily fatal or illegal, but looks like it
/// might be a programming error.  eg. attempting to remove 'nil' from an
/// NSArray, which the Spec/documentation does not prohibit, but which a
/// well written program should not be attempting (since an NSArray object
/// cannot contain a 'nil').
///
/// NB. The 'warn=yes' option is understood by the GNUstep make package
/// to mean that GSWARN should be defined, and the 'warn=no' means that
/// GSWARN should be undefined.  Default is to define it.
